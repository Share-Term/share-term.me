The main reason I created *Share Term* is that I wanted a simple and accessible solution for real time collaboration for terminals. If your collaborators are geeks, like you, they can access your terminal using their terminals. If not, your friends can watch your mad science inside of the browser and request remote control if that's needed.

I wrote [here](http://share-term.me/blog/1-hello-world) an introduction into the *Share Term* service.

The *Share Term* projects are [open source on GitHub](https://github.com/Share-Term), excepting the Bloggify core which is still closed source.
