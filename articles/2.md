*Share Term* is now launched and most of [its components are open source](https://github.com/Share-Term).

Supposing you [already installed NodeJS and NPM](https://nodejs.org/) on your machine, what you have to do now is just to install [the *Share Term* client](https://github.com/Share-Term):

<div class="installation share-term">
$ npm install -g share-term
</div>

In case this step requires root access, run it again with `sudo` or [configure NPM not to require root access when installing global packages](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/dotfiles#npm-config).

To display the help content do `share-term -h` or `share-term --help`:

<div class="installation share-term">
$ share-term -h
share-term --help
Share the terminal with your friends.

actions:
  get <id> [--control]     Connect to a terminal session. If `--control`
                           options is passed, remote control will be
                           requested.

                           the terminal sharing.

                           is connecting from a terminal.

  share-term               # Starts a shared terminal session
  share-term get <id>      # Connects to the terminal session with id <id>
  share-term get <id> -c   # Connects and asks for remote control in the
                           # terminal session with id <id>

The most important things to remember are that:

 - `share-term` starts a new terminal session giving you an url which you can share with your friends
 - `share-term get <id>` accesses a terminal session from another terminal
 - `share-term get <id> -c` accesses a terminal session from another terminal asking the session creator  for remote control
