Hi there! I'm [Ionică Bizău](http://ionicabizau.net/) and I'm happy to write the first article on this blog.

I have been working for few weeks on this service: *Share Term* – a tool for sharing the terminal sessions in browser and in another terminal, also with the possibility of requesting remote control.

Below you can see a list of projects that power *Share Term*:

 - [Bloggify](http://bloggify.org) – the high-level website and blogging framework which is behind *Share Term*
 - [Socket.IO](http://socket.io/) – *Share Term* uses it for real time updates via web sockets, fallbacking to HTTP requests
 - [pty.js](https://github.com/chjj/pty.js) – an awesome low-level library for creating a pseudo-terminal on your machine.

That is all for now. Coming soon with how to install and use *Share Term*.
