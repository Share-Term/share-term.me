I am happy to announce [*Share Term 2.0.0*](https://github.com/Share-Term/share-term). Since the [first version](http://share-term.me/blog/2-introducing-share-term) was published, there was released Node v4.0.0 which is awesome.

The [Share Term 2.0.0 client](https://github.com/Share-Term/share-term) is now compatible with the latest changes in Node.js. :tada:

I also updated the browser scripts which are loaded on the [browser side](https://github.com/Share-Term/server).

To get the latest changes, do:

```sh
$ npm i -g share-term@latest
```

Hope you will enjoy the new version! :grin:
