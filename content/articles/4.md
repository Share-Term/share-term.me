I am happy to announce Share Term 2.0.0. Since the [first version](http://share-term.me/blog/2-introducing-share-term) was released, there was released Node v4.0.0 which is awesome. The Share Term 2.0.0 client is now compatible with the latest release of Node.js.

I also updated the browser scripts which are loaded on the [browser side](https://github.com/Share-Term/share-term.me).

To get the latest changes, do:

```sh
$ npm i -g share-term@latest
```

Hope you will enjoy the new version! :grin:
